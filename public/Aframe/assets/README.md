# Assets

Include any free or paid for assets in this repo locally.

Note, this is excluded from the git repository. If you notice any changed files showing up in this subfolder, make sure to check the file is meant to be there. If it is, please update the .gitignore in the root directory to include this file, so that it no longer shows as a change in the pull request.
